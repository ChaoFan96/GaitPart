# GaitPart： Temporal Part-based Model for Gait Recognition
Thanks for the attention you paid on this work, the source code will be relased as soon as possible!
## Updates
* The paper is available [here](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Fan_GaitPart_Temporal_Part-Based_Model_for_Gait_Recognition_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf), my CV is available [here](https://pdf.maitube.com/pdf/?e=agIgmt/33v3n2)！
## Correction
* *Clerical error* at Sec4.1 -> Training Details -> 3)In OU-MVLP, the value of p in each block have been set to 2, 2, 8, 8 but not 1, 1, 3, 3 (you know, 2=2^1, 8=2^3) in real practice.
* *Clerical error* at Tab.3 -> BG#1-2 -> GaitPart(ours) -> view 90, the rank-1 accuracy in this case should be **8**4.9 but not **9**4.9!!! Fortunately, the averaged accuracy here is correct, it is indeed 91.5!
